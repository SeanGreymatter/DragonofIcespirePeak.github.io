              <img src="https://5e.tools/img/adventure/DIP/000-rta-01.png?v=1.117.4" alt="Gorthok the Thunderboar">
              <p>This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature that appears in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game.</p>
              <P>The other book that accompanies this one (called "<em>the rulebook</em>") contains the information the players need to create and advance their characters (the adventurers and heroes of the story), as well as the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.</p>
            <div class="hr-grey">

            </div>
              <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
                <p>A D&D adventure is a collection of locations, quests, and challenges that inspires you to tell a story. The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of the adventurers—and, of course, the luck of the dice. You can run <em>Dragon of Icespire Peak</em> for as few as one player or as many as five players. Each player starts with a 1st-level character.</p>
                <p>The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North—a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by lawless, untamed wilderness. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure, as everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.</p>
                <p>If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read the "Role of the Dungeon Master" section.</p>
              <h3>Role of the Dungeon Master</h3>
          <div class="hr-red">
            <hr>
          </div>
                <p>The Dungeon Master (also called "the DM") has a special role in the D&D game.</p>
                <p>The DM is a <b>referee</b>. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.</p>
                <p>The DM is a <b>storyteller</b>. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters that the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.</p>
                <p>The DM is a <b>roleplayer</b>. The DM plays the monsters and villains in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the parts of all the other characters who the adventurers meet, including helpful ones.</p>
                <p>The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you and the players have fun. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM—you're in charge of the game.</p>
              <h4>Choosing a Dungeon Master</h4>
                <p>Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p>
              <h4>DM Tips</h4>
                <p>As the DM, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they arise.</p>
                <p><b>Embrace the shared story.</b> D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.</p>
                <p><b>It's not a competition.</b> The DM isn't competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving.</p>
                <p><b>Be consistent and fair.</b> If you decide that a rule works a certain way, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play. Treat the rules and your players in a fair, impartial manner.</p>
                <p><b>Modify the adventure to suit your tastes.</b> The adventure has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your particular group of players.</p>
                <p><b>Keep a notepad and some graph paper handy.</b> Use the notepad to keep track of details such as the characters' marching order. Graph paper will be helpful if you need to draw a quick map for your players.</p>
              <h4>Improvising Ability Checks</h4>
                <p>The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation, and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes characters try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. You decide whether their attempts are successful.</p>
                <p>Ability checks only come into play if there's a genuine chance of succeeding or failing at the task. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. Conversely, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.</p>
                <p>If and when you decide that an ability check is required, ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <p><em><b>What Kind of Ability Check</b></em>. Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use.</p>
                <p><em><b>How Hard Is It</b></em>. Decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use the appropriate DC.</p>
                <p><em><b>DC 10 (Easy)</b></em>. An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</p>
                <p><em><b>DC 15 (Moderate)</b></em>. A moderate task requires a higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.</p>
                <p><em><b>DC 20 (Hard)</b></em>. Hard tasks include things beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability. Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck—or a lot of specialized training—to pull off a hard task.</p>
              <h4>Other Components</h4>
                <p>The boc containing thei adventure includes components designed th help you as the Dungeon Master. In addition to the rulebook, these components are as follows:</p>
              <h4>DM Screen</h4>
                <p>The inside of the folding screen has information that can help you while running the adventure. You can also use the screen to hide your notes and die rolls, thus keeping the players in suspense.</p>
              <h4>Poster Map</h4>
                <p>When you're ready to begin the adventure, unfold the poster map so that the map of Phandalin faces up. Here si where the adventure begins. When it comes time for the players to embark on quests, use the Sword Coast map on the reverse side to help chart their overland journey.</p>
              <h4>Cards</h4>
                <p>The box contains the folloming cards:</p>
                <p><b>Combat Step by Step Cards</b>. These identical cards outline the order of combat, as described in the rulebook.</p>
                <p><b>Condition Cards</b>. These cards describe various conditions that can affect creatures in the game. A player whose character is suffering from a condition can keep the card as a reminder, giving it back to you when the condition ends for that character.</p>
                <p><b>Initiative Cards</b>. After the characters and each group of monsters involved in a combat roll initiative, distribute these cards among the combat participants, from the highest to lowest initiative count. For example, whoever rolls the highest initiative gets the "1" card and acts first, whoever rolls the second highest initiative gets the "2" card, and so on. Keep the numbered cards for the creatures you're running.</p>
                <p><b>Magic Charm Card</b>. This card describes a special charm (see "Charm of the Storm." You become charged with the power of the storm, to the extent that tiny sparks crackle in your eyes. You can cast the lightning bolt spell (3rd-level version) as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.). Give the card to the player whose character receives the charm. Collect the card when the charm ends for that character.</p>
                <p><b>Magic Item Cards</b>. When the characters acquire a magic item and identify it, give the players the card for that item. Let the player whose character has the item keep the card for reference until the item is expended or no longer in that character's possession.</p>
                <p><b>Quest Cards</b>. When a new quest becomes available to the characters, give that quest's card to the players. Collect the card if the characters complete the quest or decide they don't want to complete it.</p>
                <p><b>Sidekick Cards</b>. If you're running the game for a single player, give the player these cards and let them choose a sidekick. The sidekick's corresponding stat block can be found in the rulebook. If the sidekick dies, collect the card; the player can't choose that sidekick again.</p>
              <div class="info-panel">
                <h4>Adventure Maps</h4>
                  <p>Maps that appear in this book are for the DM's eyes only. A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to see—hence the need for secrecy.</p>
                  <p>When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate. It's not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what's in the printed adventure. Focus on getting the shape and dimensions correct, and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.</p>

                <h3 id="forgottenrealms">The Forgotten Realms</h3>
                  <p>The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Bards sing of kings, queens, heroes, and tyrants who died long ago.</p>
                  <p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p>
                <h4>Map of the Sword Coast</h4>
              <div class="hr-red">
                <hr>
              </div>
                  <p>The map below shows a region of the Forgotten Realms called the Sword Coast. This is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds such great bastions of civilization as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow.</p>
                  <p>This map is for the DM's eyes only, as it indicates the locations of places described later in this adventure. A larger, player-friendly version of the map appears on one side of the poster map included with this adventure. The poster map of the Sword Coast can be shared freely with the players as their characters explore the region.</p>
                  <p>Geographical locations marked on both the DM's map and the players' map are described below in alphabetical order. This information is not secret, and can be shared with players if they request details about a particular location.</p>

                  <h4>Conyberry</h4>
                    <p>The Triboar Trail runs right through this abandoned town, which was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins. A dirt road extending south of the town leads to a supposedly abandoned shrine dedicated to Savras (god of divination and fate). For more information on this location, see "Shrine of Savras."</p>
                  <h4>Crags</h4>
                    <p>These rocky, windswept hills are dotted with old mines that have become infested with monsters.</p>
                  <h4>High Road</h4>
                    <p>This highway hugs the coast, connecting Neverwinter to the coastal cities of Luskan to the north and Waterdeep to the south. For years, the stretch of road south of Neverwinter fell into disuse because of frequent monster attacks. Of late, efforts have been made to keep the road safe, with light patrols of guards on horseback moving between Neverwinter and Leilon.</p>
                  <h4>Kryptgarden Forest</h4>
                    <p>This ancient forest tucked behind the Sword Mountains contains the ruins of bygone dwarven civilizations.</p>
                  <h4>Leilon</h4>
                    <p>This small town along the High Road is in the midst of rebuilding itself after being abandoned for years. Its inhabitants hail from Neverwinter and are in the paid service of the city's Lord Protector, who has tasked them with turning Leilon into a fortified settlement that can ward off threats from the Mere of Dead Men.</p>
                  <h4>Mere of Dead Men</h4>
                    <p>Travelers on the High Road, which skirts the mere to the east, must resist being lured into this cold and desolate swamp by bobbing will-o'-wisps. Countless adventurers have perished in the mere, drawn by tales of ruined castles half-sunk in the mire.</p>
                  <h4>Neverwinter</h4>
                    <p>This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown. At present, no legitimate heirs to the old Alagondar royal line are known to exist, and many believe that the line is ended. Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.</p>
                  <h4>Neverwinter Wood</h4>
                    <p>The forest east of Neverwinter seems to have a magical quality about it, or at least an air of mystical secrecy. Reclusive spellcasters are rumored to dwell deep within.</p>
                  <h4>Phandalin</h4>
                    <p>This nondescript mining settlement, nestled in the foothills of the Sword Mountains, serves as the starting location for the adventure. For more information, see "Welcome to Phandalin."</p>
                  <h4>Starmetal Hills</h4>
                    <p>This range of rocky knolls is so named because the area has been the impact site of a number of meteor showers over millennia. The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.</p>
                  <h4>Sword Mountains</h4>
                    <p>These steep, craggy, snow-capped mountains are home to scattered tribes of orcs as well as other monsters. Icespire Peak is the tallest among them. Their foothills are strewn with the ruins of bygone kingdoms, and more than a few half-forgotten dungeons and tombs.</p>
                  <h4>Triboar Trail</h4>
                    <p>This path south of Neverwinter Wood is the safest route between Neverwinter and the town of Triboar, located in the Dessarin Valley to the east (off the map). The trail is not patrolled, and monster attacks are commonplace.</p>

                  <h3 id="charactercreation">First Session: Character Creation</h3>
                    <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a game that requires several hours to play, but you can stop the game at any time and continue it later. The first session should focus on character creation—one of the most fun aspects of the game. If the players create and equip their characters with time to spare, you can begin the adventure once they're ready to go. Otherwise, congratulate them on building their characters and begin the adventure with the next session.</p>
                    <p>During character creation, your role as the DM is to let your players build the characters they want, and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party. If you have only one player, work with that player to come up with their character's backstory, then let the player decide if they want the character to have a sidekick (see "Running for One Player" below).</p>
                  <h4>Character Options</h4>
                <div class="hr-red">
                  <hr>
                </div>
                    <p>Each player has options when it comes to choosing a character race, class, and background. These options are summarized in the Character Options table. If there are multiple players in the group, encourage them to choose different classes so that the party has a range of abilities. It's less important that the party include multiple races or backgrounds, as sometimes it's fun to play an all-dwarf party or a troupe of adventuring entertainers.</p>
